* *June 2020* - **Black Lives Matter!** In wake of the ongoing police brutality and injustices experienced by the Black community, the Ethogram released a collective statement of solidarity and committment to anti-racism in our approach to outreach and content going forward. You can read our statement [here](https://theethogram.com/2020/06/05/ethogram-statement-of-solidarity/). To amplify the voices of our Black colleagues, my advisor Dr. Calisi, editor Alexia Williams, and I put together a series of profiles highlighting Black excellence for the College of Biological Science.

I recieved my Ph.D. in Animal Behavior at the University of California Davis, where I worked with Dr. Rebecca Calisi Rodr√≠guez. I investigated the physiological mechanisms of animal behavior, with a focus on the neuroendocrine basis of reproduction and stress responses during parental care. Learn more about my research [here.](https://vsfarrar.github.io/dissertation-research.html)

Additionally, I engage in discipline-based education research (DBER), and am passionate about science education and communication.

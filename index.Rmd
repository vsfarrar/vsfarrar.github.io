### _Website still in development - pardon my dust!_

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Animal Behavior at the University of California Davis, working with Dr. Rebecca Calisi Rodr√≠guez. 

My research investigates the physiological mechanisms of animal behavior, with a current focus on the neuroendocrine basis of reproduction and stress responses during parental care.

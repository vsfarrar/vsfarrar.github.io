I am a Ph.D. candidate in Animal Behavior at the University of California Davis, working with Dr. Rebecca Calisi Rodr√≠guez. 

My research investigates the physiological mechanisms of animal behavior, with a current focus on the neuroendocrine basis of reproduction and stress responses during parental care.

### Latest Updates

* Ph.D. chapters are coming out! The latest, looking at the causal effects of prolactin on mating and parental behaviors and HPG gene expression, is up on bioRxiv [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.13.472470v1.full.pdf).

* Our paper on prolactin and its receptor across the HPG axis during parental care is out now in *General and Comparative Endocrinology* ! Read it at the [open access link here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016648021002331).

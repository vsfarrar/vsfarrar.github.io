I am currently a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biology, working with [Dr. Alison Bell](https://alisonbelllab.web.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am hatching plans to study the neural and physiological changes associated with the recent loss of parental care in a population of three-spined stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*). 

I received my Ph.D. in Animal Behavior at the University of California Davis, where I worked with [Dr. Rebecca Calisi Rodr√≠guez](http://calisilab.ucdavis.edu/). I investigated the neuroendocrine basis of reproduction and stress responses during parental care. Learn more about my dissertation research [here](https://vsfarrar.github.io/dissertation-research.html).

I also engaged in discipline-based education research (DBER), and am passionate about science education and communication. You can learn more about my DBER work [here](https://vsfarrar.github.io/ber.html).

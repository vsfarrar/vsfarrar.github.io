title: "About Me"
---
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Animal Behavior Graduate Group](https://anb.ucdavis.edu/) at University of California Davis, where I'm working with [Dr. Rebecca Calisi Rodr√≠guez](http://calisilab.ucdavis.edu/) to study the neuroendocrine mechanisms of parental care and reproductive behaviors.  Specifically, I am interested in how the hormone prolactin drives tradeoffs in reproductive behaviors and the stress response while organisms focus on parental efforts.  

Before starting my Ph.D., I earned my B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Arizona, where I worked with Dr. Alex Badyaev and Dr. Renee Duckworth. After graduating in 2015, I worked as a post-baccalaureate researcher at Arizona State University with Dr. Kevin McGraw, and also taught art to K-5 public school students.

I plan to study the neural and physiological changes associated with the recent loss of parental care in a population of three-spined stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*), a species which typically shows paternal care for young. 

I plan to integrate across hormones and tissues I studied in my dissertation, such as prolactin and the effects on gonadal regulation. Stay tuned!
